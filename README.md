HTML5 Jukebox is a PHP script that scans a directory lists its contents as links. If link leads to a .mp3, .m4a or .wav file, it creates a HTML5 Audio player for it to play in. If the link is to a sub-directory, the next level down of contents is listed as links, thus enabling nested songs within albums within artists.
